// This class loads all the spell BAMs and creates an image list out of them.
// The main reason I did it this way was to for managing the icons shown in 
// the CRE spell editor. Managing a small image list that pulls from a pool of
// a lot of different images is a real pain -- the list items are associated
// in the list by an index which will change if items are deleted or added.
//
// There are not all that many spell icons (compared to items anyway).
